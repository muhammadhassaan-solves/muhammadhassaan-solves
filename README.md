# About Me:

I build systems that are fast, smart, and secure.

My work blends DevOps for speed, DevSecOps for security, and AIOps for intelligence. I love turning manual tasks into automated flows and using AI to make systems self-aware.

Letâ€™s connect and build something powerful.

Always curious. Always improving.
